- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
